            <h2>Practice Areas</h2>
                <h3>Personal Injury</h3>
                    <p>Mr. Phillips has years of experience helping clients receive fair compensation for injuries caused by the negligent and wrongful actions of others. Our starting point is always you, the client.</p>
                <h3>Real Estate Law</h3>
                    <p>Are you or your business in the process of buying or selling real estate? Do you have questions or concerns about contracts, sales or lease agreements, titles, easements, or liens?</p>
                <h3>Civil Litigation</h3>
                    <p>Are you facing a legal issue that can be defined as civil in nature? Are you seeking monetary damages in a non-criminal dispute involving personal injury, real estate, employment, workers’ comp, or property damage?</p>
                <h3>Business Law</h3>
                    <p>Are you considering forming a business? Do you know which type of business structure best suits your entity? Choosing the right legal structure for an enterprise is a critical step with major tax, liability, and growth implications.</p>
                <h3>Criminal Law Defense</h3>
                    <p>Have you been charged with a criminal offense, revocation of your probation, or are presently released on bond? Regardless of the plea, American citizens enjoy the presumption of innocence and the right to an attorney.</p>
